# WorldLeaders: A PHP pseudo code game

So it has happened, the most unforeseen action of humankind so far: you have accidentally misclicked your way to this strange git repository depicting the wonders of the world of leaders. An even more unpredictable occasion would be if you had - for whatever unconscious reason - actually cloned this repository to your own personal computer. If this is the case, I cannot guarantee that it has happened due to any reasonable reason, or due to any apparent advantage usually expected to be gained from an installation process of a software package of any kind, yet even from a vendor unknown.

As a programmer, you probably aren't going to get much out of this package if you happen to be in the hope that you could actually run this application on a web server of some sort, be it Apache, Lighttpd, Microsoft IIS (huh), or NGINX or somethiNGINg X. It is of valid PHP syntax (at least should be, haven't tested), but it's not meant to be run, as **it's meant to be played** by reading the source code just like every self-respecting nerd does when they want to learn how a software works: **not** from the manual, **not** from the docs and definitively **not** from a disorganised README.md file - always from the source of all software: the source code!

## So what is it about?

Ok, lets cut the crap. This game is supposed to be a **funny satire** describing simple iron-wired program flow that tries to mimic the behaviour of some prominent and not so prominent characters and events from the world of politics and history. Its aim is **not**, however, to be any kind of trustworthy or facts-based media of truth, nor in any case objective.

Events in the program flow are usually based on ideas gotten from reading the newspapers - which nowadays tend to be printed on a more geek-friendly material: computer or mobile device screen - rather than on a classical, rough, ink-smudging newspaper paper. Oh, and of course this modern nerd-compliant interface has the ability to provide ideas from different kind of streams too, like video and audio. None the less, the resulting output of the game will always be just plain sans-serif monospaced text - maybe with added images in the future if supported by the GitHub flavoured PhpDoc format (haven't tested) or the mightiest of all the tremendous web development IDEs, IntelliJ IDEA, and more specifically for me: PhpStorm. Well, not yet I guess, but maybe they'll add that feature at some point.

Now, on to the topic again! Sorry for the meandering style of my writing, but I am currently not - and never will be - in the mood of writing a clear, focused and formal document of any kind to any decree.

You can start playing this game from pretty much whatever file you randomly happen to lay your eyes on. There is no `index.php` and no `public` folder to start the program flow from. The information security of this project is handled very strictly: it seizes to exists - everything is publicly readable! (And should be, so if you deploy this game to some web server, please do whatever hacks necessary to edit your VirtualHost configuration or similar to make sure that PHP is actually **disabled** when serving these pages to the eagerly expecting eyes of the wild, wild internet audience. And turn directory indexing on, so that folks can actually wander around. But I'm sure it wouln't be a pleasure to play this game in a web browser at all as the output would be pretty damn ugly without any post processing and PHP code beautifying).

So perhaps the best way to play would be to clone this repository and open the game in your favourite IDE - preferably one which can provide you with features like *goto definition*, *find usages*, *autocomplete* and probably more and more artificial intelligence in the future when machines will replace the humankind and start to play this game themselves.


## Participate in

This game happens to live it's life in an open source software world full of curious coders. So if you happen to like it, why wouldn't you just go ahead and fork the repository and do your own additions and edits to continue playing this game in a two-way read-write mode?!

Whatever story idea / game flow idea you might have, create a pull request or an issue about it and we'll discuss about it :). There is no strict rules on the development of this game - at least not in this early stage. Just obey to the ambiguous style of the program flow and the general philosophy of *aim to be fun, not abusive* (more about that in the next chapter).

## Last but not least

The aim of this game is not to humiliate anyone! Not anybody real person who might have been included in this game for whatever reason, nor any people, nationality or group regardless of origin, race, country, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, political orientation, or personal features or anything. The aim is to create a game that is both fun to play and fun to develop further.

This aim of creating a fun game incorporates a responsibility to confess that sometimes bad misjudgement is done - and it needs to be fixed! So please raise an issue in GitHub if you feel that some aspects of this game are insulting, wrong or otherwise inadequate. I believe in open discussion in a game like this which is based on joking around real world events, celebrated persons with real names, and citizens who might have faced for example heavily violent fates due to the different events and actions all around the world. This game can contain black humour, but I'm trying to keep it not too heavy, and other people's feedback is really important if I happen to make a wrong judgement about whether some joke is within the limits of appropriateness. Shortly: **Aim to be fun, not abusive!**

Also worth mentioning is the fact that while this game tells narrations and sometimes even myths about real-world events or other details, the game does not claim that any content of the game would be actually accurate, valid, verified, referenced, rechecked or in any way based on facts. The goal is - after all - to develop funny stories that might be - while loosely basing on real-world events - inflated and exaggerated with fiction. This game's purpose is not to teach _information_ about real events, politics, history or facts. All event depictions, subject descriptions, or person characterisations and other contents of this game should be considered as non-trustworthy entertainment.
